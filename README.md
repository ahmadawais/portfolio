This repo contains the code for a UX rich performant and accessible portfolio site. The website is built using HTML, SCSS and Vanilla JavaScript and it doesn't uses any CSS or JavaScript libraries or frameworks. Everyone is welcome :blush: to contribute or use it as template for their own portfolio but you can't claim that it's your design.

## üöÄ Getting Started

You need [Node.js][node] to develop the site locally on your Computer.

### üîã Step #1. Install the Dependencies

```sh
   npm install
```

### üìü Step #2. Start the Development Server

```sh
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server at [`http://localhost:1234`][local] that you should browse to check the local dev version of this site.

### ‚ôªÔ∏è Step #3. Production Build

```sh
npm run prod
```

This script will create the production build that contains the site code which is optimized and minified for production.
